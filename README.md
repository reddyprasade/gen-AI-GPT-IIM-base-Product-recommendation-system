# gen-AI-GPT-IIM-base-Product-recommendation-system


            The online marketplaces have intensified the challenge of identifying products that bring into line with individual user needs, the general traditional recommendation systems, such as collaborative filtering and rule-based methods, often fail to capture the appropriate preferences and even lacks the transparency in decision-making. This project presents a GenAI-based product recommendation system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) with an agentic architecture to deliver intelligent product recommendations. The system includes a primary conversational agent to interact with users and multiple sub-agents to handle backend tasks such as data retrieval, ranking, and comparison. This Gen AI based product recommendation system with GPT/LLM technology strengthens the system with personalized, user-friendly recommendations and explainable AI, based on user constraints like budget, features, and preferences. This also employs a chief conversational agent to interact with users in natural language and gather innumerable constraints such as budget, feature requirements, and preferences. Through this we attain ranked recommendations along with human-readable explanations and comparisons for intelligent recommendation and decision-support applications in modern e-commerce environments in order to turn the entire process to ease.
